# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project is to help Seth and Tom analyze the results of the recent election. Seth and Tom have been asked by the election commission to perform an audit of the results to provide clarity of the outcome.

# Election-Audit Summary
The python script written for this audit can be very useful for future election audits. It is set up in a way where the major changes that would be needed would only be to change the csv file referenced in it and the .txt file that it outputs to. This would be an efficient way to quickly and accurately audit future elections.
